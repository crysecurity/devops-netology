### Ignored files and directories
- .idea (PyCharm settings directory)
- .DS_store (Mac OS service file)
- .tfstate files
- Local .terraform directories
- Crash log files
- Exclude all .tfvars files, which are likely to contain sentitive data, such as password, private keys, and other secrets. These should not be part of version control as they are data points which are potentially sensitive and subject to change depending on the environment.
- Ignore override files as they are usually used to override resources locally and so are not checked in
- Ignore CLI configuration files
